# Youtube-React-Project

Basic header nav component is created using the tailwind css and react

#sidebar collapse:
To implement this feature we have to make use of redux toolkit? why because we'll be touching multiple components and we cant pass it as props.
we need to have a redux global store where we will have a state and change its value according to the button click and pass that state when rendering the sidebar
